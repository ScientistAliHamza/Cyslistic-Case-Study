# Cyslistic-Case-Study
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I had performed many real-world tasks. I had worked for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and met different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I had followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
